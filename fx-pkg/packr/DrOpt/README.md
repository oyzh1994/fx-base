# DrOpt
DrOpt was downloaded from <https://github.com/jamesderlin/dropt/releases> version 1.1.1 as this is what Packr was originally written against

The Gradle script could perform git operations and checkout any branch/tag and then build it but that seemed like an excersise in excess. The code base is small and there's no real advantage to downloading it on demand.
